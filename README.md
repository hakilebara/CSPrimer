# CS Primer 

[CS Primer](https://csprimer.com) is a self-paced platform for software engineers to learn the Computer Science foundations they need, from computer architecture to distributed systems.

It was created by [Oz Nova](https://ozwrites.com/), curator of [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com), 

The core of CS Primer is a sequence of programming problems designed to teach you foundational computer science.

The purpose of this repository is to keep a copy of the problems I worked on while taking the course.
